This is my capstone project for my bachelors degree at Western Governors University.

This is a JupyterNotebook written in Python that allows a user to upload an image and have the neural network predict what the image is. 
This program detects vehicles and non-vehicle objects, such as trees, roadsigns and other obstacles a driving vehicle may encounter. Sample images have been provided in the
sample folder, which is full of images obtained from Wikipedia. To run the program, simply launch the notebook and click the play button towards the top. The code is full of comments
that will help guide the user through the process as well as give special instructions when needed.
